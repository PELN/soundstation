# soundstation
bachelorproject // redesign of soundstation.dk // laravel, mysql, javascript, jquery, bootstrap

## Project setup

For this project I have used “Mamp” to run a live web server with Apache, MySQL and PHP on a Mac OS operating system. 

To install Laravel it is required to install “Composer” which is a dependency management tool in PHP. It will utilize a “composer.json” file with important application configuration. It is also necessary to use NPM (node-package-manager) which is a javascript dependency manager, to utilize the javascript dependencies such as “axios”, “sass” etc.


Versions of the technologies used:
Laravel 7.9.2
PHP 7.2.21
MYSQL 5.7.25
